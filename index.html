                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Ada Lovelace, the world's first computer programmer, was a mathematician and visionary who made groundbreaking contributions to the world of computing in the 19th century.</p>

                <h2>Collaboration with Charles Babbage</h2>
                <p>Ada Lovelace's significant contribution came through her collaboration with Charles Babbage, the inventor of the Analytical Engine, an early mechanical computer. She translated Luigi Federico Menabrea's article about the Analytical Engine and, in doing so, added her own extensive notes that explained the engine's potential.</p>

                <h2>Ada's Notes and Contributions</h2>
                <p>Ada Lovelace's "Notes on the Analytical Engine" contained the world's first published algorithm, designed for the Analytical Engine to calculate Bernoulli numbers. She recognized that the Analytical Engine could process not only numbers but also symbolic information, foreseeing its potential for more general applications.</p>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>Ada Lovelace's work remained largely unrecognized during her lifetime but was rediscovered in the 20th century. She is now celebrated as a pioneer of computer science. Her insights into computer programming and the broader applications of computers laid the foundation for modern computing and are celebrated annually on Ada Lovelace Day, which promotes women in STEM fields.</p>
